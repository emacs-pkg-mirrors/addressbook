@section Summary

AddressBook is a simple vCard based addressbook for Emacs.

It is similar to the insidious big brother database, but instead of
using a custom format for data storage, it uses the standard vCard
format to maintain contacts data.

@node Getting the program, Installation, Summary, Top
@section Getting the program

You need the following files in order to run the addressbook:

@itemize @bullet
@item
addressbook.el
@url{http://es.gnu.org/~jemarch/downloads/addrbook/addressbook.el}
@item
A modified version of Noah Friedman's vcard.el 
@url{http://es.gnu.org/~jemarch/downloads/addrbook/vcard.el}
@end itemize

Note that since the addressbook is under heavy development and it has
not released yet, those files may change (even several times in a
day). You can use the CVS Id tag to determine if you are downloading a
new version.
   

@node Installation, Configuration, Getting the program, Top
@section Installation

Make @file{addrbook.el} and @file{vcard.el} loadable to your emacs (put the
files in a directory contained in your @code{load-path}).

You can customize the addressbook using the customize interface. If
you dont like to use customize, take a look into the sources for
interesting variables.

The most important variable to set is @code{addrbook-file}, that contain
the file where you store your contacts (a collection of vCards). It
defaults to @file{~/.addressbook}.

@node Configuration, Contacts, Installation, Top
@section Configuration

@node Contacts, Accessing the addressbook, Configuration, Top
@section Contacts

The addressbook manages a collection of contact data.

@node Accessing the addressbook, Importing and exporting contact data, Contacts, Top
@section Accessing the addressbook

There are several ways to access the addressbook:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Opening the interactive interface calling the interactive function @code{addressbook}
@item
Inserting a new contact without open the interactive interface calling
the interactive function @code{addressbook-create}
@item
Using the addressbook API (see FIXME:)
@item
From any other application that uses the addressbook API (such as a MUA).
@end itemize

Next sections of this manual discuss the interactive interface.
