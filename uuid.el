;;;; Commentary

;; This file contain an implementation of the ITU X.667 Recommendation
;; for the generation of Universal Unique Identifiers (also known as
;; Globally Unique Identifiers or GUIDs).
;;
;; Each UUID is a hexadecimal-coded ascii sequence composed by the
;; following fields (separated by the ascii hypen-minus, 45 character,
;; except between the VariantAndClockSeqHigh and ClockSeqLow):
;;
;; - TimeLow                (4 octects => 8 hexadecimal digits)
;; - TimeMid                (2 octects => 4 hexadecimal digits)
;; - VersionAndTimeHigh     (2 octects => 4 hexadecimal digits)
;; - VariantAndClockSeqHigh (1 octect => 2 hexadecimal digits)
;; - ClockSeqLow            (1 octect => 2 hexadecimal digits)
;; - Node                   (6 octects => 12 hexadecimal digits)
;;
;; For example:
;;
;;  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
;;
;; There are three standarized ways to generate the values of those
;; fields:
;;
;;   - time-based
;;   - random-based
;;   - name-based
;;
;; You can specify the generation semantics to use via the optional
;; `uuid-type' parameter to `uuid-generate'. The default method is the
;; time-based one.
;;
;; Note that, according to the ITU recommendation, uuid generators
;; should generate lower-case letters in hexadecimal encoding. On the
;; other hand, it is recommended for uuid consumers to be
;; case-insensitive regarding alphabetic characters in hex
;; strings. This implementation follows both recommendations.
